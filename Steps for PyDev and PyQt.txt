Be sure you have the PyDev plugin for Eclipse for this to work.
	You also need PyDev configured in Eclipse as well. 
		Add interpreter
			Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter
			Add it by clicking "New" and finding your Python.exe file.
1. Create form in PyQt
2. Save it into the project folder in Eclipse 
	it will be a ui file type
3. Open command prompt and navigate to where that ui document is
4. Type "pyuic4 filename.ui >> filename.py" 
	This will convert the ui file into a python file inside your Eclipse project folder
5. Open the new filename.py in Eclipse
6. You will not change this file. As you update your form, you will have to re-run that function
   pyuic4 and when you run that function it will save over your filename.py so don't write code there
7. Make a new PyDev Module. Name it whatever you want. This is where you will write your code.
8. In that file, let's call it Main.py, here is a template:

import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui 
from test import Ui_MainWindow 
#first is the name of the ui file.
#second is the name of the window in PyQt

class Main(QtGui.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__(self)
        self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = Main()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

On the 3rd line, after "from" is the name of your filename.py, and after "import" is the name of your
 window in PyQt.

9. To create functions, write the listener stuff like if a button has been clicked
	in the init function.
	Here's an example:
		self.ui.btnClick.clicked.connect(self.btnClicked)
		This means when the btnClick (as it was named on the form) is clicked, it calls the btnClicked function
	
	An example of the function is:
		def btnClicked(self):
        		self.ui.txtOutput.setText("IT WORKS")
